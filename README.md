# CopyShield

## what is CopyShield ?

CopyShield is a simple Plagiarism Detection tool, which reads collection of documents and checks for similarity between them. It  can be used to detect plagiarism in documents or source codes.

## How it works ?

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The code from each file is preprocessed to remove comments and whitespace, and all characters are converted to lowercase.

2. **n-grams Generation**: Each processed code snippet is divided into n-grams 

3. **Hashing**: The n-grams are hashed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.

4. **Fingerprinting**: A sliding window approach is used to create fingerprints from the hashed n-grams, allowing efficient comparison.

5. **Similarity Calculation**: The program computes Jaccard Similarity between fingerprints of each pair of files. If similarity exceeds a threshold , it flags the files as likely duplicates.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
```

2. Run the compiled code using the following command:
```bash
.\main .\<path to the directory containing the files to be checked>
```
