## What is CopyShield ? ü§î

CopyShield is a simple Plagiarism Detection tool, which reads collection of documents and checks for similarity between them. It  can be used to detect plagiarism in documents or source codes.

## Report Generation

### CSV Reports

The report generation feature creates three separate files with detailed information as follows:

1. **Detected Plagiarism and Similarities**: This file contains the pairs of files that are flagged as likely duplicates along with the similarity percentage.

2. **Pairwise Similarities**: This file contains list of similarity percentages between each pair of participants.

3. **Participant Plagiarism Scores**: This file contains the plagiarism score of each participant.



### HTML Report

The program generates an HTML report containing the code snippets of the all pairs of files that are flagged as likely duplicates.

#### Code Comparison Visualization üìä

Our application includes a Code Comparison Visualization feature that makes it easy to identify differences between two sets of code

##### How it works ?

The left side displays the first (who submit first) participant's code and the right side displays the second (who submit second) participant's code.
the differences are highlighted as follows:
- Green: The code that second participant added.
- Red: The code that second participant removed.
- Blue : The code that is common between the two participants.

note: the order of the participants in submission time is only available in codeforces submissions, (not in vjudge case cuz can't know who submit first ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø ).

you can see the example below to understand it better üëáüëá.

## How it works ? üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Text Preprocessing**: The code from each file is preprocessed to remove comments and whitespace, and all characters are converted to lowercase.

2. **n-grams Generation**: Each processed code snippet is divided into n-grams 

3. **Hashing**: The n-grams are hashed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.

4. **Fingerprinting**: A sliding window approach is used to create fingerprints from the hashed n-grams, allowing efficient comparison.

5. **Similarity Calculation**: The program computes Jaccard Similarity between fingerprints of each pair of files. If similarity exceeds a threshold , it flags the files as likely duplicates.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Setting up the environment

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saifadin1/CopyShield.git
```

2. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create the `.env` file: Copy the contents of the [`.env.example`](https://github.com/saifadin1/CopyShield/blob/main/.env.example) file to create a new `.env` file in the project root directory and set the required environment variables if needed.




### Fetching Submissions ‚¨áÔ∏è

First, the submissions should be fetched from the online judge (Vjudge or CodeForces especially).

#### **Vjudge**

 Simply download the submissions from the contest page as a zip file and files names will be formatted correctly as: `<submission Id>_<Verdict>_<username>_<problem name>`
 the image below shows the export submissions button in the contest page of Vjudge.

![Vjudge export submissions](https://github.com/saifadin1/CopyShield/blob/main/res/image6.png)

#### **CodeForces**

Similarly, download the submissions as a zip file from the contest page. However, there's a slight issue: the filenames are not formatted as needed. To fix this, we need to reformat them to match the required format:` <submission Id>_<Verdict>_<username>_<problem name>`.
[`CodeForcesSubmissionsReformatting`](https://github.com/saifadin1/CopyShield/tree/main/src/CodeForcesSubmissionsReformatting)
this directory contains two scripts to help you with that:
1. `codeforces_api_client.py` : this script will fetch the metadata of the submissions and save it in a json file.
2. `rename_submissions.py` : this script will rename the files in  `./src/CodeForcesSubmissionsReformatting/submissions` to be formatted so the fetched submissions should be in this path.

you can find the contest admin page in the following path: `https://codeforces.com/group/<group_id>/contest/<contest_id>/admin` and the image below shows the export submissions button in the contest admin page of codeforces.

### Compile cpp code üî®

1. Navigate to the `src` directory using the following command:

```bash
cd ./src
```

2. Compile the code using the following command:

```bash
g++ *.cpp -o main
```

3. Run the compiled code using the following command:

```bash
./src/main ./<path to the directory containing the files to be checked>
```

### Getting the reports üóÇÔ∏è

The reports will be generated in `./src/reports` directory as follows structure:

```bash
| reports
|---| result.csv
|---| pairs.csv
|---| participants.csv
|---| index.html
|---| problems_data
|---|---| A
|---|---|---|HTMLreports
|---|---|---|index.html
|---|---| B
|---|---|---|HTMLreports
|---|---|---|index.html
|---|---|..
|---|---|..
```

to view the HTML report, open the `index.html` file in the browser.


### Sending emails üì©

You should flag participants who have been verified as cheaters to send them emails in `reports/praticapnts.csv` , all the flagged participants will be marked with `False` in the `Flag` column, 
so if you confirmed that they are cheaters change the value to `True` and
you can send emails to the flagged participants by the following steps

#### Prepare a CSV file
Add a csv file with the following name `group_data.csv` in the following path `./src/sending_mails` and contains the following columns:

```bash
| Handle | Email | Name |
```

#### Set up [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) API credentials

Ensure the following environment variables are set in the `.env` file:

```bash
MAILJET_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
MAILJET_API_SECRET="<your-api-secret>"
MAILJET_SENDER_EMAIL="<your-sender-mail>"
```

#### Run the following command to send the emails

```bash
python .\src\sending_mails\send_mails.py
```






## Command-Line options ‚ò∞

* Set the threshold value for similarity
    ```bash
    --threshold, -t <value>
    ```

* Set the window size for fingerprinting
    ```bash
    --window-size, -w <value>
    ```

* Set the n-gram size
    ```bash
    --grams, -g <value>

.\src\main .\problems -t 70 -w 5 -g 3 -p 101 -e problem1,problem2
```
